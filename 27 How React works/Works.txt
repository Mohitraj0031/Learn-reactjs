Root Component:
-> The App is the main or root component of a React application.
-> It's the starting point of your React component tree.

Virtual DOM:
-> React creats an in-memory structure called the virtual DOM.
-> Different from the actual browser DOM.
-> It's a lightweight representation where each node stands for a component and its attributs.

Reconciliation Process:
-> When component data changes, React updates the virtual DOM's state to mirror these changes.
-> React then compares the current and previous versions of the virtual DOM.
-> It idetifies the specific nodes that need updating.
-> Only these nodes are updated in the real browser DOM, making it efficient.
